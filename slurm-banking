      Slurm Banking is a feature within the Slurm workload manager that allows for the allocation and tracking of resource usage against specific 
      accounts, enabling fair resource distribution and usage accountability. This system is particularly useful in multi-user, multi-group 
      environments where resources such as CPU hours, memory, and GPU usage need to be managed and allocated efficiently. 


    -  Key Concepts of Slurm Banking
      1.  Accounts and Associations:
                Accounts: Represent entities (e.g., departments, projects, or groups) to which resources are allocated.
                Associations: Define the relationships between users, accounts, and resources. Each user can belong to one or more accounts, 
                and associations can have specific resource limits or priorities.

      2.  Fairshare:

                Fairshare Factor: A metric used by Slurm to prioritize job scheduling based on historical resource usage. Users or accounts 
                that have consumed fewer resources recently are given higher priority.
                Fairshare Tree: A hierarchical structure representing the accounts and their associations, which is used to calculate fairshare 
                factors.
                
      3.  Limits and QoS:

                Resource Limits: Constraints on the amount of resources (e.g., CPU hours, memory) an account or user can consume.
                Quality of Service (QoS): A mechanism to define different levels of service for jobs, which can include limits on job runtime, 
                priority adjustments, and other scheduling policies.

      4.   Accounting and Reporting:

                SlurmDBD: The Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) is responsible for managing accounting records and providing interfaces for 
                querying resource usage.
                Accounting Tools: Tools such as sacct and sreport are used to generate detailed reports on resource usage and enforce accounting
                policies.


     -   Setting Up Slurm Banking
       1.  Configuration:

         slurm.conf:
              The main configuration file where you define general Slurm settings, including enabling the accounting storage.
              AccountingStorage: Set up the accounting storage backend, typically using AccountingStorageType=accounting_storage/slurmdbd.
              SlurmDBD Configuration: Configure the Slurm Database Daemon with appropriate database settings (e.g., MySQL or MariaDB).

       2.  Creating Accounts and Associations:

              sacctmgr: The Slurm Account Manager tool is used to create and manage accounts and associations.
    
              sacctmgr add account name=project1 Description="Project 1"
              sacctmgr add user name=jdoe account=project1   

       3.   Defining Fairshare Policies:

              Fairshare Configuration: Define fairshare policies in the slurm.conf file to ensure equitable resource distribution.
              
              PriorityType=priority/multifactor
              PriorityWeightFairshare=100000

       4.     Enforcing Limits and QoS:

                sacctmgr: Use the sacctmgr tool to set resource limits and QoS for accounts and users.
                
                sacctmgr modify account name=project1 set GrpCPUMins=100000
                sacctmgr create qos name=highpriority MaxWall=24:00:00



     - Benefits of Slurm Banking
           Resource Accountability: 
                          Ensures that resources are allocated and used according to predefined policies, promoting fair usage.
           Prioritization: 
                          Uses fairshare policies to prioritize jobs based on historical usage, helping to prevent resource hogging.
           Flexibility: 
                          Allows administrators to set up complex hierarchies and policies to manage resource allocation effectively.
           Reporting: 
                          Provides detailed usage reports to track resource consumption and aid in capacity planning and billing.

            Torque + Maui + GOLD


     torque :
                TORQUE (Terascale Open-source Resource and Queue Manager) is a job scheduler and resource manager that uses PBS to control batch 
                jobs and distributed computing resources. It's based on the original PBS project, developed by NASA, LLNL, and MRJ, and is used 
                at many government, academic, and commercial sites. 

                TORQUE manages jobs that users submit to various queues on a computer system, with each queue representing a group of resources.
                To run a job in batch mode using TORQUE, users can:
                       *  Prepare a job script that specifies the application and resources required to run it.
                       *  Submit the script to TORQUE using the qsub command.

                The PBS batch script starts by telling TORQUE what kind of resources are being requested, including things like wall time, 
                nodes, and processors. To get a complete list of options available, users can type man qsub from the command prompt when logged
                in to a machine

               TORQUE) is a job scheduler/resource manager that employs PBS. Jobs can be run either interactively or as a submitted PVS batch 
               script that is run non-interactively and subsequently controlled through TORQUE.

     MAUI   :  
               Maui is an advanced cluster scheduler that can be used as an external scheduler for the PBS resource management system. 
               It's used to improve the efficiency and control of supercomputer and cluster resources by making decisions about when, where,
               and how to run jobs. Maui does this by querying and controlling a resource management system, such as PBSPro, OpenPBS,
               Loadleveler, or SGE, and enforcing its decisions based on a set of configurable policies, priorities, and limits.

               Maui can be used in PBS by installing PBS and then untarring the Maui distribution file. Once installed, Maui can be used to
               drive PBS via the PBS scheduling API. 

               Maui can be used as an external scheduler for the PBS resource management system. In this configuration, PBS manages the job 
               queue and the compute resources while Maui queries the PBS Server and the PBS MOM's to obtain up to date job and node information.

    GOLD     :
               In the context of PBS (Portable Batch System) and HPC (High-Performance Computing) environments, GOLD refers to a resource
               management and accounting system used to track and allocate resource usage, such as CPU time, memory, and storage. GOLD is 
               particularly valuable for environments that require precise tracking and accounting of resource usage for billing, quotas, or 
               usage policies.




================================================================================================================================================

         PBS
        
        PBS stands for Portable Batch System, and Slurm stands for Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management. Both are job schedulers that
        request resources on multi-user clusters. PBS allocates computational tasks, or batch jobs, among available computing resources. 
        Slurm manages and schedules jobs submitted to clusters. 

        PBS and Slurm submission scripts both start with directives that provide the scheduler with information about the job and request 
        resources. PBS directives start with #PBS, while Slurm directives start with #SBATCH. Common directives for PBS include jobname, queue, 
        processor count, and output file. 

        In general, a PBS batch script that is a bash or csh script will work in Slurm, and Slurm will try to convert PBS directives 
        appropriately. For example, a PBS “queue” is equivalent to a SLURM “partition”. However, PBS Environment variables 
        (e.g. cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR) will not be converted by Slurm. For more complicated scripts, or for batch scripts for parallel jobs, you 
         should rewrite them in Slurm syntax. 

        (PBS) and  (Slurm) are two of the most popular job schedulers used for requesting resources allocations on a multi user cluster.
